# ROC Curves?! What on earth are they?
Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves are plots that show the relationship of a model's false positive rate to its true positive rate.

## What are the areas of interest on ROC?
  1. The top left corner of the plot is the "ideal" point as this is where the false positive rate is closest to zero with a true positive rate closest to 1.
  2. The largest area under the curve is usually better, as this correlates to a steep incline of the initial true positive rate when the false positive rate is still relatively low. [We want to maximise true positive rate while minimising false positive rate.](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc.html)
  3. The curve should sit above the linear ```y = x``` baseline model to ensure it is gaining some form of accuracy. The linear model can be described as lacking a [discriminating ability.](https://radiopaedia.org/articles/receiver-operating-characteristic-curve)
