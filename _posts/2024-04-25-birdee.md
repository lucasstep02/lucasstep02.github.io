# Birdie FastAI Example
Using the FastAI course example code and Brian Lovell's [setup](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2023/10/02/BYODImage.html), I enjoyed the first example code that sets up and trains a model on a dataset of images of birds and forests. To continue my learning within this example, I decided to change the code to see if I can train a model to detect differences in more alike objects. The perfect example I thought was the age old comparison of **Dogs vs. Cats!**

## Change bird to dog, forest to cat
To set this up, it was as simple as replcaing all occurences of ```bird``` with ```dog```, and all occurences of ```forest``` with ```cat```. The output training loss can be seen below.

  | epoch | train_loss | valid_loss | error_rate | time |
  | 0 | 0.411801 | 0.275788 | 0.098446 | 00:02 |
  | 1 | 0.278716 | 0.229886 | 0.067358 | 00:02 |
  | 2 | 0.193625 | 0.236434 | 0.067358 | 00:04 |

A training loss of approx. 0.19 is quite large and should be rectified.

## Change Number of Epochs
To gain a better training loss, I changed the number of epochs to 10. You can do this by changing the line below.
```
learn.fine_tune(10)     # Was previously learn.fine_tune(3)
```

This change had the below output.
    | epoch | train_loss | valid_loss | error_rate | time |
    | 0 | 0.339971 | 0.252946 | 0.093264 | 00:03 |
    | 1 | 0.267629 | 0.197181 | 0.088083 | 00:03 |
    | 2 | 0.205182 | 0.190885 | 0.067358 | 00:02 |
    | 3 | 0.158522 | 0.188738 | 0.056995 | 00:02 |
    | 4 | 0.126606 | 0.194034 | 0.051813 | 00:02 |
    | 5 | 0.103204 | 0.199012 | 0.051813 | 00:02 |
    | 6 | 0.086105 | 0.201797 | 0.041451 | 00:02 |
    | 7 | 0.073407 | 0.202698 | 0.041451 | 00:02 |
    | 8 | 0.063436 | 0.201876 | 0.041451 | 00:03 |
    | 9 | 0.055485 | 0.200191 | 0.041451 | 00:03 |

The training loss has been improved to a much more reasonable state here at approximately 0.06!
