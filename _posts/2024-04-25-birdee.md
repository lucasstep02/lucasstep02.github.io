# Birdie FastAI Example
Using the FastAI course example code and Brian Lovell's [setup](https://lovellbrian.github.io/2023/10/02/BYODImage.html), I enjoyed the first example code that sets up and trains a model on a dataset of images of birds and forests. To continue my learning within this example, I decided to change the code to see if I can train a model to detect differences in more alike objects. The perfect example I thought was the age old comparison of **Dogs vs. Cats!**

## Change bird to dog, forest to cat
To set this up, it was as simple as replcaing all occurences of ```bird``` with ```dog```, and all occurences of ```forest``` with ```cat```. The output training loss can be seen below.

  | epoch	| train_loss | valid_loss	| error_rate | time |
  | 0	| 0.411801 | 0.275788 | 0.098446 | 00:02 |
  | 1 | 0.278716 | 0.229886 | 0.067358 | 00:02 |
  | 2 | 0.193625 | 0.236434 | 0.067358 | 00:04 |
